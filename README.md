# endGem_IMG_Assignment
This is the project for IMG Recruitment Developers-1styear-2020. 
I have deployed my webapp using 000webhost.com . The url of my website is : https://sparshagr.000webhostapp.com/  . It is a responsive
website and therefore can also be viewed using mobile directly.

*Edit1: The leaderboard present on the website is separate for all the courses . Each course contains a sepatrate leaderboard so that the user would be able to see the top downloads of the respective courses. This makes it more user friendly. 








I am also including the source code for the same.
